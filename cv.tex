\section{experience}

\begin{entrylist}
	\entry
		{2018 -- now}
		{KPN (via Elements Interactive)}
		{Almere, Netherlands}
		{\emph{Software Engineer}\\
		Working in the Digital Engine Platform team, responsible for innovating and setting paved roads for several other teams. Worked on templating and automating several repetitive and redundant things in infrastructure, deployment, application and setup.
		Improved our nginx openresty load balancer setup together with the automation of Ansible inventory management and application class based segregation (shared on-prem environment) so we could have a lot more control and granularity of traffic and application deployment, overall performance improvement of several services and better incident response when noisy neighbours need to be isolated.
		Working on setting the paved road for migrating current Python (DRF/aiohttp) applications to Kubernetes and AWS, redesigning already existing applications to be cloud native, templating the entire CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins) from tests, preview environments and deployment, so that the teams can focus on application development.
		}

	\entry
		{2016 - 2018}
		{TunEduc}
		{São Paulo, Brazil}
		{\emph{Software Engineer \& Data Scientist}\\
		Developed a predictive machine learning model for estimating student's scores in the national exam (ENEM) and a complex Flask API to store exams results and estimate scores with live updates given the growth of exam samples that were submitted. Nearly 500.000 users with peaks of 1.000 requests/s. 
		Other things include but are not limited to: data mining, web scraping and data analysis all using Python and sometimes R.
		}
	\entry
		{2014 - 2015}
		{UFSCar}
		{Federal University of São Carlos, Sorocaba, Brazil}
		{\emph{Research Intern}\\
		I've contributed to a Master's student project where I was responsible for developing a web crawler and scraper using Python's Scrapy, in addition to that I've developed several other minor solutions using Python.
