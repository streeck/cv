\section{experience}

\begin{entrylist}
	\entry
		{2017 -- now}
		{TunEduc}
		{São Paulo, Brazil}
		{\emph{Software Engineer \& Data Scientist}\\
		I've been responsible for developing a couple more APIs for data collection and Item Response Theory, including the development of a Python \& R IRT package using RPy2.
		I've also participated more in data related tasks, all the way from extracting or mining to cleaning, processing and finally giving analysis with interesting graphs, mostly done with Python using Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, etc.
		}
	\entry
		{2016}
		{TunEduc}
		{São Paulo, Brazil}
		{\emph{Development Intern}\\
		During my internship I was given full autonomy and responsibility of developing a complex API(Flask) in which a student could estimate his National Exam score(ENEM). It ended up being used by ~420.000 users, with peaks of 600 requests per second.\\
		I've also contributed to other projects like a school geo marketing platform in Rails and some web crawling and scraping demands.}
